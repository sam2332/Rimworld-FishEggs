# ü•ö Fish Eggs - Universal Pond Stocking üêü

*"Why wait for nature when you can play aquaculture god?"*

## What Does This Do?

Ever looked at a perfectly good pond and thought, "This needs more fish"? Well, now you can do something about it! This mod lets your colonists stock any water source with fish using... fish eggs! Revolutionary, right?

## Features

üéØ **Right-Click & Stock** - Click fish eggs, target water, watch magic happen  
üåä **Works Everywhere** - Freshwater, saltwater, that weird puddle behind your workshop  
üê† **Smart Fish Matching** - System refuses to stock incompatible fish types  
üé£ **Full VFE Integration** - Works seamlessly with Vanilla Fishing Expanded  
‚öôÔ∏è **Configurable Everything** - Tweak settings until it feels just right  
üõí **Trader Goods** - Buy fish eggs from merchants  
üîç **Smart Validation** - Automatically detects and warns about missing fish egg definitions

## How It Works

1. Get some fish eggs (traders sell them, or... *creative acquisition*)
2. Right-click an egg ‚Üí "Seed Water Source"  
3. Click on any water tile with the fancy targeting cursor
4. Congratulations, you're now a fish farmer!
5. Cast your fishing rod and enjoy your artificially enhanced ecosystem

## Fish Egg Types

### Vanilla Fish Eggs
- **Salmon Egg** (Freshwater) - The classic
- **Bass Egg** (Freshwater) - Popular with anglers  
- **Tilapia Egg** (Freshwater) - Hardy and reliable
- **Cod Egg** (Saltwater) - Deep sea favorite
- **Bluefish Egg** (Saltwater) - Aggressive predator
- **Catfish Egg** (Freshwater) - Bottom feeder
- **Piranha Egg** (Freshwater) - For the adventurous
- **Tuna Egg** (Saltwater) - Big game fishing
- **And many more!**

### VCE Fishing Eggs
- **Anchovy Egg** (Saltwater) - Small but mighty
- **Angelfish Egg** (Saltwater) - Beautiful swimmers
- **Koi Egg** (Freshwater) - Ornamental favorite
- **Lobster Egg** (Saltwater) - Technically not fish, but tasty
- **Swordfish Egg** (Saltwater) - Apex predator
- **And dozens more!**

## Requirements

- RimWorld 1.6
- Vanilla Fishing Expanded (the fish need somewhere to swim to)

## Balance Notes

- Fish eggs rot after 5 days (fish don't wait forever)
- Water type matters (salmon are smart, but not *that* smart)  
- Stocked fish integrate with vanilla population mechanics
- Your colonists get Animals XP for successful seeding (fish whispering is a skill)

## Compatibility

‚úÖ Safe to add to existing saves  
‚úÖ Works with most water-related mods  
‚úÖ VFE integration tested extensively  
‚úÖ Static definitions ensure reliable save compatibility  
ü§î May cause spontaneous aquaculture addiction  

## For Modders

This mod uses **static ThingDef definitions** for all fish eggs, ensuring maximum compatibility and reliability. If you're adding new fish types, the mod will automatically detect missing egg definitions and warn you in the logs.

### Adding New Fish Eggs
1. Create a new ThingDef with defName format: `FishEgg_{YourFishDefName}`
2. Set the thingClass to `FishEggs.ThingWithComps_FishEgg`
3. Add appropriate modExtension with fish reference and water type
4. The validation system will automatically detect and validate your addition

## Recent Updates

- **Benefit:** Improved save game compatibility and UI reliability
- **Added:** Validation system that warns about missing fish egg definitions
- **Fixed:** Stockpile categorization issues that prevented proper UI display
- **Performance:** Eliminated runtime generation overhead

### v1.0.2 - Job Count Fix
