# Fish Eggs Mod - Adoption Enhancement Recommendations

## Priority 1: User Experience Improvements (High Impact, Low Effort)

### 1.1 Enhanced Visual Feedback
- **Stocked Water Indicators**: Add subtle glow/tint to stocked water tiles (similar to growing zones)
- **Fish Type Identification**: Color-coded ripples (blue=freshwater, cyan=saltwater)
- **Success/Failure Audio**: Distinct sound effects for successful vs failed seeding attempts

### 1.2 Improved Settings Interface
```csharp
// Recommended new settings:
public bool showStockedTileIndicators = true;
public bool enableAudioFeedback = true;
public bool showFishTypeTooltips = true;
public float eggSpoilageMultiplier = 1.0f;
public bool requireSkillChecks = false;
```

### 1.3 Tutorial Integration
- **Mail/Letter Introduction**: Auto-trigger when first fish egg is acquired
- **Contextual Hints**: Show water type compatibility in right-click menu
- **Getting Started Quest**: Simple tutorial chain teaching basic aquaculture

## Priority 2: Content Expansion (Medium Effort, High Value)

### 2.1 Fish Discovery System
```csharp
public class FishEncyclopedia : GameComponent
{
    private HashSet<ThingDef> discoveredFish = new HashSet<ThingDef>();
    private Dictionary<ThingDef, int> stockingSuccesses = new Dictionary<ThingDef, int>();
    
    public void RegisterDiscovery(ThingDef fishDef) { /* ... */ }
    public bool IsDiscovered(ThingDef fishDef) { /* ... */ }
    public void RegisterSuccessfulStocking(ThingDef fishDef) { /* ... */ }
}
```

### 2.2 Fish Breeding Infrastructure
- **Aquaculture Station**: Building that slowly produces fish eggs from stocked areas
- **Fish Hatchery**: Advanced facility for controlled breeding
- **Fish Farm Zones**: Designated water areas with enhanced productivity

### 2.3 Seasonal & Event Systems
- **Spawning Seasons**: Fish only produce eggs during specific seasons
- **Fishing Tournaments**: Periodic map-wide events with rewards
- **Rare Fish Events**: Special weather creates opportunities for exotic fish

## Priority 3: Advanced Features (High Effort, High Reward)

### 3.1 Research Integration
```xml
<ResearchProjectDef>
  <defName>BasicAquaculture</defName>
  <label>basic aquaculture</label>
  <baseCost>600</baseCost>
  <prerequisites>
    <li>AnimalHusbandry</li>
  </prerequisites>
  <researchViewX>6.00</researchViewX>
  <researchViewY>3.20</researchViewY>
</ResearchProjectDef>
```

### 3.2 Quality & Genetics System
- **Fish Quality Tiers**: Poor, Normal, Good, Excellent, Masterwork fish
- **Genetic Traits**: Disease resistance, size variants, nutrition bonuses
- **Breeding Programs**: Cross-breeding for desired traits

### 3.3 Economic Ecosystem
- **Fish Market Fluctuations**: Dynamic pricing based on rarity/season
- **Trade Specialization**: Colonies known for specific fish types get better prices
- **Export Contracts**: Long-term agreements for steady fish supply

## Priority 4: Polish & Professional Features
